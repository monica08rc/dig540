## Week 14 - Form and content

Connect platforms with content.

**Assignment**  

1. Choose a platform that we've discussed in class (e.g., Omeka S, Scalar, CollectiveAccess, or custom PHP page), or another platform that you're already familiar with;
2. Choose a theme from one of the three articles that we read (e.g., Indigenous-led Knowledge Production, Transactional Archives, etc);
3. Write a blurb to Slack that details what the archive would look like in the platform that you chose (e.g., what a Transactional Archive might look like in Omeka S, if possible);
4. Create one or more examples in the platform that you chose and link to the example(s) in your blurb (e.g., upload a representative media item with appropriate metadata, or create a path in Scalar, or a custom webpage, etc, that support your detailed description and link to it from your blurb).

Let me know if you have any questions or comments!

**The assignment should be done by Monday Dec. 13th**
