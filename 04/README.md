**Assignment**

All parts of the assignment are discussed in the intro video above.

Part 1: Create a new dynamic web page that uses the Omeka S API as its data source:
- Create a new file in your computer's web/dig540 folder (alongside vocabulary.php and common.css) and save it as "collection.php";
- Open up "vocabulary.php" and copy the contents of that file into "collection.php";
- In "collection.php" change the data feed URL to that of your Omeka S install's API Items feed;
- Follow the instructions in the video to adapt the rest of the PHP, HTML, and CSS to the Items feed;
- Follow the instructions in the video to add a Dublin Core Description to our previously uploaded Item and make sure that the description is being output in our PHP page;
- Upload "collection.php" to your Reclaim Hosting account alongside vocabulary.php and common.css and view in the web browser!

Part 2: Add to your Omeka S install and create a new Site:
- Decide on a theme for your Omeka S install collection;
- Add at least four more items to give a total of five items in your install;
- Create a Site and attach your five items to that Site;
- View the Site in the web browser!

Part 3: Head back to your dynamic web page to see how it looks with the added Omeka S content!

Part 4: Write a blurb to Slack commenting on the presentation of your content in two distinct locations (your Omeka S install and your dynamic PHP page)... include links to the dynamic PHP page and Omega S Site.

If you run into any problems, make sure to ask questions on Slack!

**The assignment should be done by Wednesday Sept. 29th.**
