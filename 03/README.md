**Assignment**

All parts of the assignment are discussed in the intro video above.

Part 1: Upstream sync your dig540 repository with the main repository (same as last week).

Part 2: Use GitHub Desktop (which you installed in Week 1) to sync the Web/dig540 folder on your computer with your forked GitHub repository.

Part 3: Style your existing vocabulary.php file using CSS:
- Add CSS style declerations inside of "style" tags at the top of the file and test by uploading the file to the server and refreshing the browser;
- Once you have the style how you like it, copy-paste it into a new file, called "common.css";
- At the top of vocabulary.php, replace the "style" tags with a single "link" tag to "common.css?v=1";
- Upload both files (vocabulary.php and common.css) to the server and post the URL to vocabulary.php on Slack.

Part 4: Install "Omeka S" on your Reclaim Hosting account using cPanel's single-click install:
- Follow the video's instructions to install "Omeka S" on your Reclaim Hosting server, then visit the new Omeka S install;
- From the Omeka S intro page, visit the Admin Area, and add a new Item;
- In the Admin Area, also create a new Site and post its URL to Slack;
- Determine the URL to the API of the Omeka S install, go to its list of items, and you'll see the Item(s) that you uploaded.

If you run into any problems, make sure to ask questions on Slack!

**The assignment should be done by Wednesday Sept. 22nd.**
